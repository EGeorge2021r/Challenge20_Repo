# Challenge20_Repo
Create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses and able to control a joint savings account.

## User Story
Role: Fintech Finder’s lead developer

Goal: To develop and test the code that will integrate the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

Reason: Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them

## Requirements
1. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. 
2. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.


## Execution Steps
The execution of this project is broken into three steps:

- Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity

- Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM

- Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract

## Libraries and dependencies
The following libraries and dependencies were deployed:
- Remix IDE
- JavaScript VM

## Execution Results
The execution results can be viewed in the execution result folder with the following output screenshots:
